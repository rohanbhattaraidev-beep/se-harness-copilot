# gate-check.sh — PreToolUse hook on Bash (v0).
# HITL gate enforcement (A5 #5): blocks irreversible actions (PR creation, push, deploy)
# while no approved requirement exists in .harness/requirements/.
# Reads the hook JSON on stdin; v0 parses with grep (no jq dependency).
# Exit 2 = block with message to the agent; exit 0 = allow.
#
# Phase 5 (workspace-orchestration plan §5.3): an approved REQ whose impact spanned 2+
# components also gets a REQ-NNN/workspace-plan.md sibling file (see templates/workspace-plan.md
# for the row shape). If one exists, every row must reach `status: done` too — approving the
# requirement is not approving incomplete cross-component work. A REQ with no workspace-plan.md
# (the common single/few-component case, §5.0) is completely unaffected by this.
#
# Phase 8 (§5.4): every row being `done` means each component passed its OWN gate in
# isolation — it does NOT mean the pieces work together. workspace-plan.md's frontmatter also
# carries `integration: pending|passed|failed`, set by the workspace-orchestrator only after
# the combined check actually ran. This gate requires `passed` too, so a feature can never be
# described as complete solely because individual rows finished.
