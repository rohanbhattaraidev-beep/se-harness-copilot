# org-validate.sh — PostToolUse hook on Edit/Write (v0).
# Machine-checkable second pass for org conventions (A5 #7, WaveMaker pattern B11):
# warns when an edited file imports a library the org has banned, so the agent
# self-corrects toward internal/preferred libraries (compose-first rule).
#
# v0 rule source: .harness/org-rules.txt — one rule per line, format:
#   banned:<pattern>[:<replacement hint>]
# Example:
#   banned:moment:use dayjs (org standard)
#   banned:lodash:use @acme/utils
# Later phases generate this file from profile.yaml's org: section.
# Exit 0 always (warn, don't block) — blocking on style is too aggressive for v0.
